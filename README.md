# Rock Paper Scissors Simulation

## Description
This is a simple simulation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, where objects of each type (Rock, Paper, Scissors) move randomly in all directions. When two objects collide, the game determines the winner and transforms the loser into the winner's type. The simulation continues until one type successfully dominates, winning the game.

## Features
- Simulates the movement of 10 Rock, 10 Paper, and 10 Scissors objects.
- Collision detection to determine winners and losers.
- Objects transform into the winning type upon collision.
- The simulation continues until one type dominates.
